    "##  Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting high-risk cancer patients using real-world healthcare claims data. Built on Databricks with Delta Lake architecture and MLflow experiment tracking, this project showcases production-grade data engineering and machine learning best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "Healthcare providers need to identify high-risk cancer patients at the time of diagnosis to:\n",
    "- Allocate resources effectively\n",
    "- Provide early intervention for malignant cases\n",
    "- Improve patient outcomes through proactive care management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "Developed a predictive model that achieves **93% accuracy** in identifying high-risk cancer patients using only features available at admission time, ensuring real-world applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Results\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Value | Interpretation |\n",
    "|--------|-------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Accuracy** | 93.15% | Correctly identifies 93% of patients |\n",
    "| **Precision** | 86.84% | When model predicts high-risk, it's correct 87% of time |\n",
    "| **Recall** | 100% | Catches ALL high-risk patients (no false negatives) |\n",
    "| **F1 Score** | 92.96% | Strong balance of precision and recall |\n",
    "| **ROC AUC** | 88.80% | Excellent discrimination capability |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical Significance:** 100% recall means no high-risk malignant cancer patients are missed by the model.\n",

    "## Key Learnings & Problem Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Leakage Identification & Resolution\n",
    "**Problem Identified:** Initial models achieved unrealistic 100% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Cause:** Features included outcome variables:\n",
    "- `total_claim_amount`, `length_of_stay_days` (only known after treatment)\n",
    "- These directly revealed the target variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Implemented:**\n",
    "1. Redefined prediction problem to use only admission-time features\n",
    "2. Removed all outcome-based features (cost, length of stay)\n",
    "3. Restructured target variable to `is_high_risk_patient` (Malignant vs. other)\n",
    "4. Achieved realistic 93% accuracy with production-ready model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:** Demonstrates strong ML fundamentals and production readiness awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features Used (No Data Leakage)\n",
